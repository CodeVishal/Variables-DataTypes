***Interger data type -->

int---->
The integer data type size in java is 2 bytes .
The integer data type Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
The integer data type 32 bits


Since the int data type can only store numbers in a particular range, 
what will you do if you wish to store a larger number? Or if you want to store a really small number, 
would you want the computer to allocate a large chunk of memory which int occupies? 
Clearly, for storing larger numbers and optimal memory usage, we need different “containers” or data types.

 

***Long -->
 The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. 
 This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. 
 Note that you should end the value with an "L":
 
 Long contains 64 bits
 
 e.g 
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);



** Short --->
The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:
short consists of 16 bits


***Decimal Data storing ---->

**float--->
This data type can store numbers with 7 digits after the decimal.
Note that you should end the value with an "f"
This is 32 bits

e.g 
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);


**double--->
This is 64 bits
This data type can store numbers with 16 digits after the decimal
double d = 1.234568
Use float or double?

The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. 
The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of 
about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

Note: Remember to append “f” to the number before storing it in a float variable to make 
sure that it is not interpreted as a double. 


***Char--->
The char data type is used to store a single character. 
The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

It is 16 bit data types
e.g 
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);

** boolean---->
Boolean datatype can store only two values like 'false' or 'true'

e.g 
boolean x = true; ----> Internally stores value 1

boolean y = false; ----> Internally stores value 0

boolean a = 1;  ---> THis is not valid statement

Size of boolean data type is 1 bit



** byte --->
byte datatypes contains number pershaps integer
byte  x = 20; ---> Allocate 8 bits
