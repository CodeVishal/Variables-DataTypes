use the Scanner class to prompt the user to input the values.

Explanation of the Scanner Code

First you wrote the following statement to be able to use the Scanner class:

Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);

Here, “input” is the name of your Scanner. You can name the Scanner absolutely anything(like choosing variable names).

This statement “new Scanner(System.in)” prompts Java to provide you with a new Scanner 
to “scan” the input given by users.

 

You can then use the following statement to read some integer data given as input from the user:

a=input.nextInt();

Here, the “.nextInt()” keywords tell you scanner(named “input”) to look for the next data entered 
by the user and store it in the variable “a”.

 

Remember, for Java to know where should it get the code for the Scanner from, 
you have to add the following statement at the top of your code file:

import java.util.Scanner;
