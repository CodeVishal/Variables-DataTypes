In Java, +, -, and * are the symbols used for addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively. 
For division, the “/” symbol is used

Dividing two integers will always give back an integer. So dividing 5 by 4 will give you 1 and not 1.25. 
The portion after the decimal is ignored.

Similarly, dividing two doubles always gives back a double. So dividing 4 stored in a double variable by 2 stored 
in a double variable will give back a double, 2.0 and not an int, 2.

An operation performed on variables of int data type will always return an int 
value only and hence can lead to information loss.

 the mod operator is used to store the remainder of the division between two numbers. 
 It is very useful in cases such as trying to find an odd number or checking divisibility,
