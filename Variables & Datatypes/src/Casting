“Casting”. This is a process that will let you know how you can convert one data type to another.
 It is helpful in many situations and will be of immense use to you 
when you write programs. Let’s see how you can go about it.


Just to recap, in case you want to convert an int variable ‘x’ to a double, you write it like this:

 

(double) x.

And now, you can store this in another double variable, say, ‘y’. So, double y = (double) x; 
will convert an int ‘x’ to a double and store the value in ‘y’.

Please note that here x is converted to a double only for the statement double y = (double) x; . 

 The variable “x” remains of the type int only; i.e. if you use x somewhere else, it will behave as an int. 
 Hence this is just a temporary conversion to a double.
 
 
 for characters casting----->
 a='A';
int b;
b= (int) a;
System.out.print(b);

You must be able to observe the output as:

65

 

Here, “65” represents the character “A”. 
Such representations are standardized by ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
