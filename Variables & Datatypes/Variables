How to declare and initialise variables — eg. int distance = 0;

How to update variable values — <Variable Name> = <Variable Name> + <Update Value>

How to print the value stored inside a variable — System.out.println(<Variable Name>)


***Now there are a few rules in Java that govern the names given to variables. 
You can name variables under these rules only. Let’s learn what these rules are. 
As far as the formatting of your code is concerned, these are the guidelines you should follow. 
We advise you to have a look at them to learn them as a good practice. A few of the important guidelines from the same document are as follows:

 

***Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:

1.No line break before the opening brace.

2.Line break after the opening brace.

3.Line break before the closing brace.

4.Line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or named class. 
For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma.

5.Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces. 
When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. 
The indent level applies to both the code and comments throughout the block.
